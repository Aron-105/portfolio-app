Welcome to the first actual entry in the devlog!

Today, I'll sort of be catching everyone up to where I am at the time of creating my portfolio site. It's going to cover the main sources of inspiration for the game, as well as some personal takeaways from each.

let's get into it!

## Inspiration and Where it Comes From

When thinking back on the many games that i've played over the years, there are a few that really stand out to me as sources of inspiration for this project. The games that have really stuck out to me in terms of exceptional design are **Hades**, **Devil May Cry 5**, **Breath of the Wild** , and **Super Mario Odyssey**.

Here's what I noticed about each of these games, potentially thinking about the type of game I would want to make using the principles learned.

### Hades
